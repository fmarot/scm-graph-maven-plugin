= Usage

Should work best (ie more predictible) if you suffix your scm urls with ".git" (so we know exactly where to truncate).
This is helpfull because a not-so-known "feature" of Maven is that every child modules sees it's artifactId appended at the end of
the scm urls declared in it's parent pom :/

Id does not display the FULL tree because we only got the 'resolved' dependencies. This means that if A->B->C and A->C we 
will not see B->C in the graph. For more info, refere to the dependency:tree plugin TreeMojo class and it's comments regarding the "verbose"
flag (refer to this thread: http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/Access-the-full-dependency-tree-in-a-Mojo-Maven-3-td5915491.html ).

A call for halp has been made here: http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/Access-the-full-dependency-tree-in-a-Mojo-Maven-3-td5915491.html

= Graph library

The graph library used is JGraphX (which is the successor to JGraph) and the user manual is available here: https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual_javavis.html

This library seems not very Maven friendly (new/recents builds are not made available automatically on Maven central).

= TODO

* add this plugin in all builds and to Jenkins JenkinsFile to be archived on each build

* investigate why some git repo point to themselves whereas some other do not (but on first thought it seems they should)
* add project name in generated png file
* detect git cycles (would require the full dependency tree, see http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/Access-the-full-dependency-tree-in-a-Mojo-Maven-3-td5915491.html )
* use special color for specific vertex:
	* SCMRepo with no scm tag defined should be red
* test, test test !!! Test with "Maven Invoker Plugin" instead of the fucked up maven-plugin-testing-harness...
* we could encapsulate in the graph all the dependencies belonging to a given repo. It would give us
a classic maven dependency graph, but with dependencies groupped by their scm repo of origin
* use Travis & deploy to Maven Central

= DONE
* removed some pattern from being displayed in Graph (such as gitlab.xxx-yyy.local:)
* remove JGtaphT and use only JGraphX
