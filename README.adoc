= Usage

Should work best (ie more predictible) if you suffix your scm urls with ".git" (so we know exactly where to truncate).
This is helpfull because a not-so-known "feature" of Maven is that every child modules sees it's artifactId appended at the end of
the scm urls declared in it's parent pom :/

= TODO

test with "Maven Invoker Plugin" instead of the fucked up maven-plugin-testing-harness...
